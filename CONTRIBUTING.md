### Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here's a quick rundown!

### Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your own Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Fork the Repo and create a Branch for any Issue that you are working upon.
- Read the Code of Conduct
- Create a Pull Request which will be promptly reviewed and suggestions would be added to improve it.

## Fork this repository

This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

* Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). 

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/user-name/PDF-Dark-Mode.git
```

where `user-name` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the PDF-Dark-Mode repository on GitHub to your computer.

git pull upstream main
```
